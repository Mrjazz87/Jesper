                <p>Hi! My name is Jesper and currently work as a Business Analyst at Avanade Sweden, focusing on CRM systems.
                    I'm very passionate about technology and learning new skills, that's why I built this website on my spare
                    time and as a showroom for when I complete other projects. Below you can find some of the skills i have
                    aquired through my previous work experiences.
                </p>

            <div class="job job-1">
                <h3>Service</h3>
                <h6>Customer Focused</h6>
                <p>I started out working as a service technician for about 8 years. During this time, I learned to keep the
                    customer and their needs in focus, by always listening to what they said. During this time, I also figured
                    out that I want to help people.
                    <em>That's why I think, understanding of people is equally important as to having the skills to code.</em>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="job job-2">
                <h3>Business and Finance</h3>
                <h6>ERP's and other Financial Systems</h6>
                <p>During my time at University, I kept myself busy by having extra jobs on the side, which gave me the experience
                    to work with ERP's and Financial systems like SAP and Fortnox. Besides this, I also learned more about
                    working and contributing more as a team.
                    <em>This is also when I figured out that I function best when working within a Team.</em>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="job job-3">
                <h3>IT</h3>
                <h6>Skills and Methodologies</h6>
                <p>I currently work as a Business Analyst Consultat within CRM, where I learned to work more project based,
                    with methodologies like SCRUM. In my role, I've learned to help Customers forming and breaking down requirements
                    by holding Workshopshops with Stakeholders.
                    <em>During my time as Business Analyst, I figured out that I want to work close to the Business I'm helping
                        so that I better can understand their needs and what they want to achive.</em>
